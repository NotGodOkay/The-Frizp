A game for everyone!
A retro 2D platformer similar to Mario! A demo of what is to come. You take the role of the hero Frizpy whom is on his way to save Princess Butterfly from the evil Satanists. He will travel his home land (Loyalty Land) and above. Right now you're limited to the starting region and on your way to stop King Fraizko's rule over your people.

On your way you must collect gems to gather strength for the final confrontation with the Anti-Christ. (Note: Saving the game isn't possible yet so collect gems for fun and practice)

A farmer that went out on a dangerous adventure to save a beautiful maiden. He grew tired of the rules of Fraizko and wanted to give his all to make things good again.

## Instructions

It's clean and simple. Use the arrow keys to move Frizpy left/right and up to jump. The P key pauses.

Remember to eat hearts. Not only is it natural for Frizps but it also gives you lives.

Enemies are nothing but trouble. Decide if you want to jump on their heads or not.
