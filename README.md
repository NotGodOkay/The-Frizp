A game for everyone!
A retro 2D platformer similar to Mario! A demo of what is to come. You take the role of the hero Frizpy whom is on his way to save Princess Butterfly from the evil Satanists. He will travel his home land (Loyalty Land) and above. Right now you're limited to the starting region and on your way to stop King Fraizko's rule over your people.

On your way you must collect gems to gather strength for the final confrontation with the Anti-Christ. (Note: Saving the game isn't possible yet so collect gems for fun and practice)
